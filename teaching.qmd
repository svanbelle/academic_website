This PhD course explores the analysis of survival timesâ€”the duration between a defined start and end event, such as time from diagnosis to recovery. Applications include clinical and epidemiological studies where interest lies in comparing treatment effects, assessing prognostic factors, and handling incomplete data due to censoring. Emphasis is placed on statistical methods designed to accurately analyze and interpret time-to-event data.
